# Ansible Introduction Hands-on Workshop

## What knowledge and skills do we aim to develop?
* Basics of Ansible concepts.
* Write own basic playbooks for common tasks (e.g. deploy a web server, automate simple sysadmin tasks, etc. ).
* Use git to check out and commit Ansible playbooks.
* Confidence to continue using Ansible by oneself and look into further resources (Ansible Galaxy, etc), and interest in further hands-on workshops


## How to achieve that?

* With a friendly workshop for all sysadmins and developers who are interested in  Ansible and would like some guided exercises to get started.

    * Absolute maximum duration: 2 hours
    * A few slides to introduce Ansible basic concepts
    * Exercises of progressive difficulty level on:
        * Apache Hello World (or Nginx Hello World as alternative)
        * Sys Admin Tasks (e.g chrony)
        * Infra Admin Tasks
    * And a reference to Ansible use in Taito

And why not continuing the Apache thread by a ops_playbook to for example update apache on all the nodes or why not how to add the oh-so important [ http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/#apache | http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/#apache ]
